> Zamaneh Media—Van Ons Bulk Block Converter for WordPress 5 Gutenberg blocks

Convert all classic content to blocks. An extremely useful tool when upgrading to the WordPress 5 Gutenberg editor. This plugin owes a debt of gratitude to the [Organic Themes](https://organicthemes.com/) [Bulk Block Coverter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-block-converter/) from which it was forked.
